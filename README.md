# How to get the scripts: #
1. Get an __Internet Card__ (Tier 2 - This means you need at least T2 computer case!)
2. Execute in your OC computer the following:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePoleThatFishes/NC-feat-OC-scripts/master/[the script you want] [the name you want to save the script as]`
*Note: square brackets are not needed when executing the command!*
3. The script is successfully installed in your computer, all you need to do is connect the controller block to the computer using cables, and run the script!
