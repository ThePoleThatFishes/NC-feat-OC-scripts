A repo of OC scripts for NuclearCraft's reactors!

# How to get the scripts: #
1. Get an __Internet Card__ (Tier 2 - This means you need at least T2 computer case!)

2. Execute in your OC computer the following:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePoleThatFishes/NC-feat-OC-scripts/master/[the script you want] [the name you want to save the script as]`

*Note: square brackets are not needed when executing the command!*

3. The script is successfully installed in your computer, all you need to do is connect the controller block to the computer using cables, and run the script!

# FAQ #
**Q: Is a MSR/HX script planned?**

A: Not at the moment, but maybe.

**Q: Will there be graphics support for the scripts?**

A: No, scripts will stay text-only to reduce resource costs. No fancy graphics like the reactor GUIs! Sorry :P

**Q: Will you make overhaul scripts?**

A: Not for the time being. I am waiting on NC:O to be feature complete, and have OC support.
The turbine's OC port seems to work like its preoverhaul counterpart, and some testing shows the turbine script also works for overhaul!

**Q: What are legacy-versions?**

A: As the name implies, it's older versions of the scripts, with fewer features (and more bugs probably!), and as such they are deprecated, I suggest not downloading them!
